### Student Registry Module
The Student Registry module which provides a structured and organized logic to create and manage student data. This` module is divided into three submodules: 
- types
- implementations
- utils
```
|-- src/
|   |-- main.rs
|   |-- student_registry/
|       |-- mod.rs
|       |-- implementations/
|       |   |-- mod.rs
|       |   |-- student_impl.rs
|       |
|       |-- types/
|       |    |-- mod.rs
|       |    |-- student_types.rs
|       |
|       |-- utils/
|       |    |-- mod.rs
|
|-- Cargo.toml
```
This structure ensures that the code is well-organized, modular, and scalable, making it easier to manage and extend the functionality of the student registry system; thus facilitating a clear separation of data structures and their associated logic.
